# World University Rankings

## Project Goal:
Investigate the best universities in the world.

## Motivation:
Of all the universities in the world, which are the best?
Ranking universities is a difficult, political, and controversial practice.
To investigate the best universities in the world, we look at the
[Times Higher Education World University Ranking](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/2023/world-ranking) which is widely regarded
as one of the most influential and widely observed university measures.

## Objective:
Determine the top 10 Universities in the world.

## Source:
The source of this data is from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mylesoneill/world-university-rankings). Which is formed of a community
of data scientists and developers. It is the world’s largest data science
community with over one million registered users. Members can talk about
development models, explore data sets, or network across 194 separate
countr ies around the world. I will only focus on The Times Higher Education
World University Ranking Data, which is widely regarded as one of the most
influential and widely observed university measures.


## Scope:
The Times Higher Education World University Ranking 2016,
which includes institutions from 79 countries, represents an elite
5 per cent of the world’s higher education institutions.

## Collection:
The data was compiled and scraped from the times higher
education website so it should be dependable. They write on their website
about Data Collection "Institutions provide and sign off their institutional data
for use in the rankings. On the rare occasions when a particular data point is
not provided, we enter a low estimate between the average value of the
indicators and the lowest value reported: the 25th percentile of the other
indicators. By doing this, we avoid penalizing an institution too harshly with a
“zero” value for data that it overlooks or does not provide, but we do not
reward it for withholding them".

## Contents:
The Times Higher Education World University Rankings are global
performance tables that judge research intensive universities across all their
core missions: teaching, research, knowledge transfer and international
outlook. They use 13 performance indicators to provide comprehensive and
balanced comparisons, trusted by students, academics, university leaders,
industry, and governments.

The performance indicators are grouped into five areas:

#### Teaching (the learning environment)
#### Research (volume, income, and reputation)
#### Citations (research influence)
#### International outlook (staff, students, and research)
#### Industry income (knowledge transfer)Industry income (knowledge transfer)

## Limitations & Exclusions:
Universities are excluded from the World University
Rankings if they do not teach undergraduates or if their research output
amounted to fewer than 1,000 articles between 2011 and 2015 (and a
minimum of 150 a year). Universities can also be excluded if 80 per cent or
more of their activity is exclusively in one of the eight subject areas.
